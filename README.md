# CIH Bank Data Analytics and Prediction Tool

A comprehensive data analytics and predictive modeling tool focused on analyzing customer behavior to enhance financial services and promote digital payment solutions in Morocco.

## Project Overview
This project involves:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, cleaning, and integrating multiple datasets (clients, transactions, online operations, etc.).
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating features such as `days_since_last_transaction`, `avg_transaction_amount`, and `age_group` for in-depth analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training a Random Forest Classifier and applying SMOTE for balanced predictions.
- **Clustering**: Using KMeans clustering to identify customer segments and analyze transaction patterns.
- **User Interface**: A Tkinter-based tool for inputting client data and displaying prediction results.

## Key Features
- **Data Visualization**: Insights into digital payment trends through plots like age group transaction patterns.
- **Prediction Tool**: Classifies transaction types with high accuracy.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifies distinct customer profiles for targeted strategies.

## Methodologies Used
- **Data Preprocessing**: StandardScaler for feature standardization.
- **Modeling**: Random Forest Classifier with accuracy and feature importance evaluation.
- **Clustering**: KMeans for customer segmentation.
- **SMOTE**: Applied for addressing class imbalance in training data.
